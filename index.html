            <p>Venezuela, is a country in America located in the northern part of South America, consisting of a continental part and a large number of small islands in the Caribbean Sea. Its borders are delimited to the north with the Caribbean Sea, 
            to the west with Colombia, to the south with Brazil and to the east with Guyana, with whom it maintains territorial disputes. The country has a very high biodiversity and ranks seventh in the world list of nations with the largest number 
            of species. Habitats range from the Andes mountains in the west to the Orinoco basin rainforest in the south, through the extensive plains of the Llanos, the Caribbean coast, and the Orinoco river delta in the east. </p>
