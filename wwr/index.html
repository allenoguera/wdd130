      <p>Rafting is more than just a sport; it's a metaphor for life. As you navigate through the rapids, you'll face challenges that will test your strength, courage, and teamwork. 
      Remember, in the face of adversity, there is growth. Embrace the unknown, for it is where true discovery lies.</p>

      <h2 class="home-headline-1">We run Rivers to relax.</h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph-1">Experience the gentle rhythm of the river as it carries you away from the demands of everyday life. Let the sounds of nature's symphony lull you into a state of deep relaxation. Allow the currents to guide you to a place of calmness and rejuvenation.</p>

      <h2 class="home-headline-2">We run Whitewater for the Rush.</h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph-2">That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</p>
