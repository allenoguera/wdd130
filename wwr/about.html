    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="history-content">
    <p>In 1985, a group of outdoor enthusiasts came together with a shared passion for white-water rafting. They started taking groups of friends and family on rafting trips down local rivers, and soon realized that they could turn their love of rafting into a business.
    The founders of the company, named "White Water Rafting Co." started with just a few rafts and a handful of guides. They quickly gained a reputation for providing safe, fun, and thrilling rafting experiences for people of all ages and skill levels.
    Over the years, Rapids Adventures expanded their offerings to include multi-day rafting trips, team-building exercises, and custom packages for corporate groups and other organizations. They also added new locations for their rafting adventures, 
    including some of the most challenging and picturesque rivers in the country.</p>
    <p>Despite the growth of the company, the founders have always remained committed to their core values of safety, fun, and adventure. They have continued to invest in state-of-the-art equipment and training for their guides, and have built a loyal customer 
    base that returns year after year for their exciting and memorable rafting experiences.
    Today, Rapids Adventures is one of the most respected and popular rafting companies in the industry, with a team of experienced guides and staff who are passionate about sharing their love of white-water rafting with others.</p>
